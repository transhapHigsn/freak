# How to contribute

## Dependencies

We use `poetry` to manage the [dependencies](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).
If you dont have `poetry` installed, you should run the command below.

```bash
make download-poetry
```

To install dependencies and prepare [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks you would need to run `install` command:

```bash
make install
```

To activate your `virtualenv` run `poetry shell`.

## Codestyle

After you run `make install` you can execute the automatic code formatting.

```bash
make codestyle
```

### Checks

Many checks are configured for this project. Command `make check-style` will run black diffs, darglint docstring style and mypy.
The `make check-safety` command will look at the security of your code.

You can also use `STRICT=1` flag to make the check be strict.

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/transhaphigsn/freak/blob/master/Makefile) contains many functions for fast assembling and convenient work.

<details>
<summary>1. Download Poetry</summary>
<p>

```bash
make download-poetry
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

```bash
make install
```

If you do not want to install pre-commit hooks, run the command with the NO_PRE_COMMIT flag:

```bash
make install NO_PRE_COMMIT=1
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Check the security of your code</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches a `Poetry` and `Pip` integrity check as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`. By default, the build will not crash if any of the items fail. But you can set `STRICT=1` for the entire build, or you can configure strictness for each item separately.

```bash
make check-safety STRICT=1
```

or only for `safety`:

```bash
make check-safety SAFETY_STRICT=1
```

multiple

```bash
make check-safety PIP_STRICT=1 SAFETY_STRICT=1
```

> List of flags for `check-safety` (can be set to `1` or `0`): `STRICT`, `POETRY_STRICT`, `PIP_STRICT`, `SAFETY_STRICT`, `BANDIT_STRICT`.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Check the codestyle</summary>
<p>

The command is similar to `check-safety` but to check the code style, obviously. It uses `Black`, `Darglint`, `Isort`, and `Mypy` inside.

```bash
make check-style
```

It may also contain the `STRICT` flag.

```bash
make check-style STRICT=1
```

> List of flags for `check-style` (can be set to `1` or `0`): `STRICT`, `BLACK_STRICT`, `DARGLINT_STRICT`, `ISORT_STRICT`, `MYPY_STRICT`.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Run all the codestyle formaters</summary>
<p>

Codestyle uses `pre-commit` hooks, so ensure you've run `make install` before.

```bash
make codestyle
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Run tests</summary>
<p>

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Run all the linters</summary>
<p>

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-safety && make check-style
```

> List of flags for `lint` (can be set to `1` or `0`): `STRICT`, `POETRY_STRICT`, `PIP_STRICT`, `SAFETY_STRICT`, `BANDIT_STRICT`, `BLACK_STRICT`, `DARGLINT_STRICT`, `ISORT_STRICT`, `MYPY_STRICT`.

</p>
</details>

<!-- <details>
<summary>8. Build docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker VERSION=latest
```

More information [here](https://github.com/transhaphigsn/freak/tree/master/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Cleanup docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make clean_docker
```

or to remove all build

```bash
make clean
```

More information [here](https://github.com/transhaphigsn/freak/tree/master/docker).
